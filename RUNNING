# Once you have those pieces you can install and run as follows:

cd ~/dev # Or wherever you keep your code...

#
# Download Ohcount, and rewind it to a very old version (pre C-conversion)

# How to use it to measure a project
#
# Suppose that your project's git repository is stored at ~/dev/myproject/
#
cd ~/dev/ohdb
bin/ohdb -r ~/dev/myproject/ init
bin/ohdb -r ~/dev/myproject/ make # This will take a while
bin/ohdb -r ~/dev/myproject/ activity --group-by month --group-by name

# You can monitor progress of a 'make' with
bin/ohdb -r ~/dev/myproject status
